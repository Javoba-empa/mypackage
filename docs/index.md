### Writing the documentation

Once the configuration is done, we need to create the documentation.
The documentation is written in Markdown and is stored in the `docs` directory in the root of the repository.
Usually, you start with a single Markdown file named `index.md` that contains the main page of the documentation.
Then, you can create sub-pages and sub-directories to organize the documentation.
